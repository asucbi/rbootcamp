**PRE-LAB ACTIVITIES**

Please ensure you have successfully installed R and RStudio, or are working on RStudio Cloud, and that you have completed the tasks on the [ADD URL] page, which introduced the basics of a) how to navigate around Rstudio, b) how to create a Rmarkdown document, c) how to read data into R, and d) how to use R to do basic arithmetic.

__Information about solutions__

Solutions for these exercises are available immediately below each question.  
We would like to emphasize that much evidence suggests that testing enhances learning, and we __strongly__ encourage you to make a concerted attempt at answering each question *before* looking at the solutions. Immediately looking at the solutions and then copying the code into your work will lead to poorer learning.  
We would also like to note that there are always many different ways to achieve the same thing in R, and the solutions provided are simply _one_ approach.

In this lab, we are going to take a look at how to access specific sections of data, before we move on to talking about different types of data.

We encourage you to work along with the reading - open a new RMarkdown document, and run the code which we discuss below.  
   
At the end there is a set of exercises for you to complete. 

# Accessing parts of the data  

Suppose we read some data into R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
starwars2 <- read_csv("https://asucbi.github.io/data/starwars2.csv")
```

:::yellow
__Reading data from a URL__

Note that when you have a url for some data, such as [https://asucbi.github.io/data/starwars2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asucbi/data/master/starwars2.csv), you can read it in directly by giving functions like `read_csv()` the url inside quotation marks.
:::

The data contains information on various characteristics of characters from Star Wars.
We can print out the top of the data by using the name we just gave it:
```{r}
starwars2
```

Alternatively, you could use the `head()` function which displays the first six rows of the data by default. You could change this by saying, for example, `head(data, n = 10)`:
```{r}
head(starwars2)
```

_(Don't worry about the_ <NA>s _for now, they are just how R tells you an entry is missing, i.e. Not Available.)_

:::green
__Tip:__ Try clicking on the data in your __environment__ (the top right window of RStudio). It will open the data in a tab in the editor window - this is another way of looking at the data, more like you would in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.
This can be time-consuming if your data file is big.
:::

We can take a look at how big the data is (the dimensions), using `dim()`
```{r}
dim(starwars2)
```

There's a reasonable amount of data in there - `r nrow(starwars2)` rows and `r ncol(starwars2)` columns.
In the __starwars2__ data, each character is an __observational unit__, and there are 6 __variables__ (things which vary between units) such as their _height_, _species_, _homeworld_, etc.

:::yellow
__Units and variables__

The individual entities on which data are collected are called __observational units__ or __cases__. Often (but not always), these equate to the rows of a dataset.

A __variable__ is any characteristic that varies from observational unit to observational unit (these are often the columns of the dataset)
:::

What if we want to extract certain subsections of our dataset, such as specific observational units or variables?
This is where we learn about two important bits of R code used to access parts of data - the dollar sign `$`, and the square brackets `[]`.

:::frame
__The dollar sign $__

The dollar sign allows us to extract a specific variable from a dataframe.
For instance, we can pull out the variable named "eye_color" in the data, by using `$eye_color` after the name that we gave our dataframe:
```{r}
starwars2$eye_color
```
:::

Each variable in a dataframe is a vector. Once extracted, we will have a vector and not a dataframe.

:::frame
__The square brackets []__

Square brackets are used to do what is known as __indexing__ (finding specific entries in your data).
We can retrieve bits of data by identifying the $i^{th}$ entry(s) inside the square brackets, for instance:

```{r}
# assign the numbers 10, 20 ... 100 to the name "somevalues"
somevalues <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

# pull out the 3rd entry
somevalues[3]
```

In the above example, we have a __vector__ (a single sequence of values), and so we can retrieve entries with the syntax:
<center>
**vector[entry]**
</center>
<br>
In a __dataframe__ we have an extra dimension - we have rows _and_ columns. Using square brackets with a dataframe needs us to specify both:
<center>
**dataframe[rows, columns]**
</center>
:::

Let's look at some examples:
```{r}
# first row, fourth column:
starwars2[1, 4]

# tenth row, first column:
starwars2[10, 1]
```

<br>

If we leave either rows or columns blank, then we will get out __all__ of them:
```{r}
# tenth row, all columns:
starwars2[10, ]

# all rows, 2nd column:
starwars2[ , 2]
```

<br>

There are is another way to identify column - we can use the name in quotation marks:
```{r}
# first row, "species" column
starwars2[1, "species"]
```
<br>
Finally, we can also ask for multiple rows, or multiple columns, or both! To do that, we use the combine function `c()`:
```{r}
# the 1st AND the 6th row,
# and the 1st AND 3rd columns:
starwars2[c(1,6), c(1,3)]
```
<br>
And we can specify a sequence using the colon, `from:to`:
```{r}
# FROM the 1st TO the 6th row, all columns:
starwars2[1:6, ]
```

Why? Because the colon operator, `from:to`, creates a vector from the value `from` to the value `to` in steps of 1.
```{r}
1:6
```
`r optbegin(label="Extra: Combining $ and []. Click to expand", olabel=FALSE)`
We can use the two accessors in combination:

```{r}
# extract the variable called "name" and show the 20th entry
starwars2$name[20]
```

This represents the 20th name in the data.

__Note:__ When we do this, we don't have the comma inside the square brackets.
When we use the `$` to pull out a variable, such as `starwars2$name`, we no longer have a dataframe - `starwars2$name` doesn't have rows and columns, it just has a series of values - _it's a vector!_.
So when you are using `[]` with a __vector__ (1 dimension) rather than a __dataframe__ (2 dimensions), you don't specify `[rows, columns]`, but simply `[entry]`.
`r optend()`


:::yellow
__The dollar sign $__

Used to extract a variable from a dataframe:

+ `dataframe$variable`

__The square brackets []__

Used to extract parts of an R object by identifying rows and/or columns, or more generally, "entries". Left blank will return all.

+ `vector[entries]`
+ `dataframe[rows, columns]`
:::

## Changing specific entries {-}

Above, we looked at the subsection of the data where the _species_ variable had the entry "Droid". Some of you may have noticed earlier that we had some data on C3PO. Is he not also a droid?

<center>
![](images/types_of_data/c3po.png)
</center>

(Looks pretty Droid-y to me! _disclaimer: I know nothing about Star Wars_ &#128578; )

Just as we saw above how to _access_ specific entries, e.g.:
```{r}
# 2nd row, all columns
starwars2[2, ]
# 2nd row, 6th column (the "species" column)
starwars2[2,6]
```

We can change these by __assigning them a new value__ (remember the `<-` symbol):
```{r}
# C3PO is a droid, not a human
starwars2[2,6] <- "Droid"

# Look at the 2nd row now -
# the entry in the "species" column has changed:
starwars2[2, ]
```

# Exercises

For the exercises, we have a dataset on some of the most popular internet passwords, their strength, and how long it took for an algorithm to crack it. The data is available online at https://asucbi.github.io/data/passworddata.csv.

| Variable Name | Description            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| rank   | Popularity in the database of released passwords |
| password     | Password |
| type     | Category of password  |
| cracked     | Time to crack by online guessing |
| strength     | Strength = quality of password where 10 is highest, 1 is lowest |
| strength_cat     | Strength category (weak, medium, strong) |

`r qbegin(1)`
Open a new Rmarkdown document.

__File > New File > R Markdown..__
`r qend()`

---

`r qbegin(2)`
In your first code-chunk, load the _tidyverse_ packages with the following command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Make sure you run the chunk.
`r qend()`

---

`r qbegin(3)`
Read in the data from the link (https://asucbi.github.io/data/passworddata.csv).

You may notice that the url ends with __.csv__. This means we can use the `read_csv()` function to read it into R.

Be sure to assign it a name, otherwise it will just print it out, and not store it in R's environment!
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
pwords <- read_csv("https://asucbi.github.io/data/passworddata.csv")
pwords
```
`r solend()`
